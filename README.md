jquery.larne.touch
==================

This library is a wrapper for touch events. It simulates mouse events.
- You need only attach the mouse event, for example "mousemove". "touchmove" will automaticly be used. All mouse events should work on touch devices as expeted.
- Possible events are simulated: mousedown, mouseup, mousemove, click, dblclick, contextmenu, mousewheel.
- Mousewheel support: Double tab and hold down, than "touchmove" is in "mousewheel" mode. It may optimized in the future.
- Scrolling and pinch to zoom is still possible!

Usage: Just load the jquery.larne.touch.js. No configuration requied.
